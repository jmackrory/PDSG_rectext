# Sentiment Analysis with Board Game Data

This uses Python to do some sentiment analysis for board game reviews.
The data was gathered by Matt Borthwick (www.dive-into.info) from www.boardgamegeek.com,
a popular boardgame enthusiast site.
This was done as part of the Portland Data Science Group's Applied Data Science series.

Currently this does some simple regression based on the wordcount matrices.
As a baseline it uses a Naive Bayes model to dig out most positive/negative words.
It then compares that to regularized linear regression, using ridge regression.

I also used earlier code for a neural network (3 layers, ReLU activation),
after the SVD for dimensionality reduction.

From another notebook I have working (but terribly inefficient) code to use pre-trained wordvec
and a LSTM network to predict scores.  It's super slow, and requires some fiddling to make it
work efficiently. 

Includes some libraries for SVMs using the approximate kernel method (which I did not code up),
and the ensemble method.

Could then train an ensemble method from the existing predictors too.  

Most of these are trained on the RMSE, but it might make sense to use a weighted RMSE instead
to weight rarer occurences, given the skew in the data. 

(Note this basical combines the toxic comment analysis, and boardgame recommendations).

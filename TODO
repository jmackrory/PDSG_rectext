TODO:
- Build data pipelines for each model
- Scale scores?  Play with quantiles
- Do Cross-validation to select hyper parameters (vectorization choices, regularization, network depth/width/activation)
- Get RNN working on GPU
- Get SVM
- create sklearn metric for weighted errors use mean_squared_error with sample_weights.
- Spark (word counts, ALS)
